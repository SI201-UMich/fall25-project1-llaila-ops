# SI 201 Project 1: Data Analysis - Penguin Metrics
#
# Name: Laila Larkins
# Date: October 11, 2025
#
# Description: This program imports the 'penguins.csv' dataset, performs three
#              unique calculations based on bill and flipper dimensions, and
#              writes the resulting data, including the new metrics, to a new CSV file.
#              The code implements a robust function decomposition and includes
#              unit tests for all major calculation functions.
